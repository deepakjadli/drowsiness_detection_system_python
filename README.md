# drowsiness_detection_system_python
A real-time drowsiness detection system using Dlib and OpenCV leverages computer vision techniques to monitor driver fatigue and enhance road safety. The system uses OpenCV to capture live video feed and Dlib's pre-trained facial landmark detector to identify key points on the face, such as the eyes and mouth. By calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and monitoring it over time, the system detects prolonged eye closure, which is a key indicator of drowsiness. Alerts, such as sound or visual warnings, are triggered when drowsiness is detected, helping to prevent accidents caused by fatigue.
